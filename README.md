## **To do React app**

#
## **Instalation**
#

<pre>
    <code>
        git clone https://github.com/lubomskirafal/basic-webpack-boilerplate.git
        npm i
    </code>
</pre>
<br />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br />

#
## Available Scripts
#

In the project directory, you can run:<br />

### **For development server**

<pre>
    <code>
        npm start
    </code>
</pre>
<br />

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br />

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.<br />

### **Production build**

<pre>
    <code>
        npm run build
    </code>
</pre>
<br />


Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.<br />

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!<br />

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### **Remove the single build dependency**

<pre>
    <code>
        npm run eject
    </code>
</pre>
<br />

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration<br /> choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will <br />remove the single build dependency from your project.<br />

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the<br /> transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right<br /> into your project so you have full control over them. All of<br /> the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will <br />point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this<br /> point you’re on your own.<br />

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set <br />is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you <br />shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we <br />understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t <br />customize it when you are ready for it.<br />
